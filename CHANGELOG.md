## 3.6.0

* `Area`
  * Allow changing size, flex, min and max values.

## 3.5.0

## 3.4.0

* `MultiSplitView`
  * Added `areaClipBehavior` to control area clipping.

## 3.3.0

* `Area`
  * Added `copyWith` method.
* `MultiSplitView`
  * Added `onDividerDragStart` and `onDividerDragEnd` callbacks.

## 3.2.2

* Bugfix: The divider does not move when the widget's size includes a tiny fractional value.

## 3.2.1

* Bugfix: `MultiSplitViewController` throwing error when being built or modified to have no areas.

## 3.2.0

* `Area`

* Avoiding rebuilding areas when hovering over the divider.

## 3.1.0

* `Area`
  * The `widget` attribute has been removed. Developers may have encountered unintended behavior when using `widget` as it retained the last context, resulting in unexpected fixed states. Going forward, only the `builder` attribute will be available, ensuring dynamic updates based on the current context.
  * The `builder` function was replaced by `AreaWidgetBuilder`, thus receiving the area as an extra argument. 
  * New attribute: `index`
* `AreaWidgetBuilder`
  * The argument `index` has been removed.

Bugfix: Stretching to recover the minimum size when space is available.

## 3.0.0

* `Area`
  * The algorithm has been changed to use `flex` factor instead of `weight`.

  * New attribute: `max`.
* `Theme`
  * The `dividerThickness` now can be zero.
* `OnWeightChange` has been replaced by `OnDividerDragUpdate`
* `MultiSplitViewController`
  * The `areasLength` attribute has been renamed to `areasCount`

## 2.4.0

* `Area`
  * Replacing the factory constructor with a default constructor.
  * The `copyWithNewWeight` method has been removed.
* `MultiSplitViewController`

## 2.1.0

* `OnSizeChange` renamed to `OnWeightChange`.
  * Removing `childIndex1` and `childIndex2` parameters.

  * Window resizing allowing area with a size smaller than the `minimalSize`.
  * `OnWeightChange` is not getting notified on window resizing.
* Fixing the README example.

## 2.0.1

* Bugfix
